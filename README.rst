Communicating Sequential Processes in Go
########################################

This is some Go code I wrote while reading `Communicating Sequential Processes <csp book_>`_, by C. A. R. Hoare. I figured if I could implement some of the concepts in chapter 1, Processes, and particularly those in section 1.4, Implementation of Processes, I'd have more confidence in what I learned.
